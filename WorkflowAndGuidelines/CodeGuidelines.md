# Code guidelines

To keep the source consistent, readable, modifiable and easy to merge, we use a fairly rigid coding style. All patches will be expected to conform to the style.

MuseScore code style and conventions are based on the [Qt code style](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Coding_Style) and [conventions](https://wiki.qt.io/Coding_Conventions), but there are some differences.

## Coding Style

* [C++](#c++)
* [Qml](#qml)
* [CMake](#cmake)

## C++

### Indentation

* 4 spaces are used for indentation
* Spaces, not tabs!

### Declaring variables

* Declare each variable on a separate line
* Avoid short or meaningless names (e.g. "a", "rbarr", "nughdeget")
* Single character variable names are only okay for counters and temporaries, where the purpose of the variable is obvious
* Wait when declaring a variable until it is needed
* For pointers or references, no space between the '*' or '&' and type(__different from Qt__)
* Always initialize the variable with the initial value.

```C++
 // Wrong
 int a, b;
 char *c, *d;
 const Type &val = ...
 void func(const Type &val);

 // Correct
 int height = 0;
 int width = 0;
 char* nameOfThis = nullptr;
 char* nameOfThat = nullptr;
 const Type& val = ...
 void foo(const Type& val);
```

* Variables and functions start with a lower-case letter. Each consecutive word in a variable's name starts with an upper-case letter (camelCase)
* Constants all uppercase letters  and underscore to separate words
* Avoid abbreviations

```C++
 // Wrong
 short Cntr;
 int panel_height = 0;
 char ITEM_DELIM = ' ';

 // Correct
 short counter = 0;
 int panelHeight = 0;
 const char ITEM_DELIMITER = ' ';
```

* Classes and structures always start with an upper-case letter.
* Acronyms are camel-cased (e.g. XmlReader, not XMLReader).
* Data members of classes are named like ordinary nonmember variables, but with a prefix underscore (__different from Qt__)

```C++
 // Wrong
 class counter
 {
 ...
 private:
     int count;
 }

 class HTMLParser
 {
 ...
 private:
     char* m_data;
 }

 // Correct
 class Counter {
 ...
 private:
     int _count = 0;
 }

 class HtmlParser
 {
 ...
 private:
     char* _data = nullptr;
 }
```

### Whitespace

* Use blank lines to group statements together where suited
* Always use only one blank line
* Always use a single space after a keyword and before a curly brace:

```C++
 // Wrong
 if(foo){
     ...
 }

 // Correct
 if (foo) {
     ...
 }
```

* Surround binary operators with spaces
* Leave a space after each comma
* No space after a cast, avoid C-style casts when possible

```C++
 // Wrong
 char *blockOfMemory = (char* ) malloc(data.size());

 // Correct
 char* blockOfMemory = reinterpret_cast<char*>(malloc(data.size()));
```

### Braces

* Use attached braces: The opening brace goes on the same line as the start of the statement. If the closing brace is followed by another keyword, it goes into the same line as well:

```C++
 // Wrong
 if (codec)
 {
     ...
 }
 else
 {
     ...
 }

 if (codec) {
     ...
     }

 // Correct
 if (codec) {
     ...
 } else {
     ...
 }
```

* Exception: Function implementations (but not lambdas) and class declarations always have the left brace on the start of a line:

```C++
 static void foo(int g)
 {
     ...
 }

 class Moo
 {
     ...
 };
```

* Do not put multiple statements on one line
* If the body of the expression consists of one line, add braces anyway (__different from Qt__)

```C++
 // Wrong
 if (foo) bar();

 if (foo)
     bar();

 // Correct
 if (foo) {
     bar();
 }

```

* Do not put 'else' after jump statements:

```C++
 // Wrong
 if (thisOrThat)
     return;
 else
     somethingElse();

 // Correct
 if (thisOrThat) {
     return;
 }

 somethingElse();
```

### Parentheses

* Use parentheses to group expressions:

```C++
 // Wrong
 if (a && b || c)

 // Correct
 if ((a && b) || c)

 // Wrong
 a + b & c

 // Correct
 (a + b) & c
```

### Line breaks

* Keep lines shorter than 120 characters; wrap if necessary
* Commas go at the end of wrapped lines; operators start at the beginning of the new lines. An operator at the end of the line is easy to miss if the editor is too narrow.

```C++
 // Wrong
 if (longExpression +
     otherLongExpression +
     otherOtherLongExpression) {
 }

 // Correct
 if (longExpression
     + otherLongExpression
     + otherOtherLongExpression) {
 }
```

### General exceptions

* When strictly following a rule makes your code look bad, feel free to break it.
* If there is a dispute in any given code, create a pull request with the proposed changes to the style code.

## Qml

In general, the same style as for C++

* Property names as well as C ++ variable names, for "private" properties you need to add an underscore suffix

```javasctipt
 // Wrong
 Item {
     property var cntr
     property var internal_data

     ...
 }

 // Correct
 Item {

     property var counter: 0
     property var _data: null

     ...
 }
```

* The opening brace goes on the same line as the start of the statement (with no exceptions)

```javasctipt
 // Wrong
 Rectangle
 {
     width: 40
     height: 20
     ...
 }

 function do_something()
 {
     ...
 }

 // Correct
 Rectangle {

     width: 40
     height: 20
     ...
 }

 function doSomeThing() {
     ...
 }
```
